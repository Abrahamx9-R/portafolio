# Portfolio
![Portfolio](/portafolio.png)

This portfolio was created using Astro, Three.js, and Tailwind.

It is inspired by the tones of Star Trek and Tron, my favorite series and movies. I wanted to give it a futuristic touch that reflects what I am most passionate about: applied physics, in this case, applied to technology.

## Technologies

### Core
- <img src="/icons/astro-icon.png" alt="Astro Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Astro**: I chose Astro because most sections of my portfolio are static, and this framework allows for fast and optimized websites, perfect for superior performance.
- <img src="/icons/threejs-icon.png" alt="Three.js Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px; filter: invert(1);" /> **Three.js**: I used Three.js to add a dynamic and visually appealing touch to the portfolio, simulating a space environment that complements the futuristic theme.
- <img src="/icons/tailwind-icon.svg" alt="Tailwind Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind enabled me to design directly in HTML with predefined classes, speeding up development and ensuring style consistency.

### Self-Hosting
- <img src="/icons/docker-icon.png" alt="Docker Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Docker**: I used Docker to ensure the portfolio runs consistently in any environment, allowing me to manage multiple instances and scale easily with Swarm.
- <img src="/icons/dockploy-icon.png" alt="Dockploy Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Dockploy**: Dockploy automates the deployment of my portfolio, saving me time and effort every time I make changes.
- <img src="/icons/cloudflare-icon.png" alt="Cloudflare Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Cloudflare**: I implemented Cloudflare to protect the portfolio against DDoS attacks and enhance its performance through its content delivery network (CDN).
- <img src="/icons/traefik-icon.png" alt="Traefik Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;" /> **Traefik**: Traefik manages traffic routing and SSL certificates, ensuring requests are handled efficiently and without interruptions.

## Conclusion

This portfolio is not only a showcase of my technical skills but also an expression of my passion for applied physics and technology. By using Astro, Three.js, and Tailwind, I have created a website that is both visually appealing and technically robust. Additionally, the use of Docker, Dockploy, Cloudflare, and Traefik ensures that my portfolio is secure, fast, and easy to maintain.
